The Car Agency System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline inventory management for a car agency. It boasts a range of features, including reading and saving car data from files, handling customer orders via a queue system, managing sold cars through a stack mechanism, and facilitating various administrative tasks such as adding, deleting, updating, and searching for car brands and individual cars within those brands.

Customers benefit from a user-friendly interface that allows them to navigate through available car brands, place orders efficiently, and utilize filters to refine search results according to their preferences.

Administrators enjoy robust functionality, enabling them to process orders, remove sold cars from inventory, and generate insightful reports detailing the last 10 cars sold. The system harnesses the power of LinkedLists, Queues, and Stacks for efficient data storage and retrieval, complemented by a sleek graphical user interface implemented using JavaFX.
